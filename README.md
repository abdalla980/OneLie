🎭 One Phone, One Lie

One Phone, One Lie is an offline, in-person social deduction party game built with Flutter.
One phone is passed around a group of friends. One player lies. Everyone watches.

No accounts. No internet. No setup.

🕹️ How It Works

Players sit together and share one phone

Each round, one player is secretly chosen as the Liar

A question appears

Everyone answers out loud

Players vote on who they think lied

The liar is revealed

Repeat

👥 3–10 players · 📍 Same room · 📴 Offline
